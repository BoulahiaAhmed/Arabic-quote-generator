I will use the Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR)
step by step:
1. generate several condidate generation
2.compare condidate against each others using ROUGE score
3.choose the sample with the highest average similarity

MBR: arg max 1/n sum( ROUGE (E,E'))
basically we are going to calculate a weighted sum for each ROUGE SCORE between a condidate E and the other contidates E'.
the condidate with the highest average similarity is the one we are going to choose.
